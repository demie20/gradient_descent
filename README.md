# Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that's used when training a machine learning model. It's based on a convex function and tweaks its parameters iteratively to minimize a given function to its local minimum.
Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm for finding the local minimum of a function.

To find the local minimum of a function using gradient descent, we must take steps proportional to the negative of the gradient (move away from the gradient) of the function at the current point. If we take steps proportional to the positive of the gradient (moving towards the gradient), we will approach a local maximum of the function, and the procedure is called Gradient Ascent.

Gradient descent was originally proposed by CAUCHY in 1847. It is also known as steepest descent.
